📌 QR-Based Attendance System

A QR-Based Attendance System is a digital solution that automates the process of marking attendance using Quick Response (QR) codes 📱.
Instead of manually maintaining attendance records, this system enables an invigilator or teacher to scan a QR code to mark students' attendance in real time. ✅

✨ Key Features

🔹 Unique QR Code Generation

✅ Each student receives a unique QR code linked to their identity.

🔄 QR codes can be dynamic (changing per session) or static (per student).


🔍 QR Code Scanning for Attendance

📷 The invigilator scans the student's QR code using a mobile or web-based scanner.

🕒 The system automatically records attendance with a timestamp.

📊 Daily Attendance Logs

🗂 Stores attendance records for each session.

📌 Allows administrators to track student attendance history.
